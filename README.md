# CoderSchool Full Stack Mail App

Created with love by: Jade

This repo includes a documentation of how to create a web application in MERN stack **from scratch** as well as a demo app following the instructions. The app allow user to send email to other users within the app platform.

## Features

- User management and login flow
- State management with redux
- CRUD for messages
- Error handling and notification
- And more..

## Implementation

### Server side

When developing a full-stack web, it is common to have the web's backend develop prior to front-end. One of the main reason is, it would be easier to have the database ready when implementing the front-end logic of the web.
